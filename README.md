# 🏆 Project Contest Platform

An enterprise-grade **Competition Management Platform** enabling individuals and teams to create, register, manage, and participate in competitions.  
It supports **multi-judge scoring**, **dynamic participation modes** (individual/team), and is ideal for real-world scenarios such as innovation challenges, hackathons, academic contests, and open competitions.  
Designed with **scalability**, **modularity**, and **high extensibility** to meet complex competition management needs.

## 🚀 Quick Start

Follow these steps to quickly set up and run the full platform:

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ShousenZHANG/project-contest-platform.git
   cd project-contest-platform
   ```

2. **Prepare environment variables**  
   Create a .env file in the project root with your required secrets and credentials (e.g. JWT, email account for notifications):
   ```bash
   MAIL_USERNAME=your-email@example.com
   MAIL_PASSWORD=your-smtp-app-password
   JWT_SECRET=your-jwt-secret
   GITHUB_CLIENT_ID=your-github-client-id
   GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET=your-github-client-secret
   GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=your-google-client-id
   GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=your-google-client-secret
   ```

3. **One-command full stack startup**  
   Build and start all backend, frontend, database, and infrastructure services with one command:
   ```bash
   docker-compose up --build -d
   ```
   ⏳ The first startup may take several minutes for image build and initialization.

4. **Manually verify database connection (IMPORTANT!)**

   After all services have started, **use Navicat**, **DataGrip**, or **any MySQL client** to **manually connect** to the database.  
   Open the `project_contest_platform` database and verify the tables are properly initialized.

   > ⚡ **This step is essential.**  
   > If you do not manually connect and verify the database connection at least once,  
   > accessing the frontend or APIs may result in errors like **Internal Server Error: Could not open JDBC Connection for transaction**.

   Example connection information:
   - **Host:** `localhost`
   - **Port:** `3306`
   - **Username:** `root`
   - **Password:** `root`
   - **Database:** `project_contest_platform`

5. **Access the platform**
  - Swagger API Docs: [http://localhost:8080/doc.html#/home](http://localhost:8080/doc.html#/home)
  - Frontend Web App: [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

## ⚙️ Jenkins CI/CD (Continuous Integration & Deployment)

This project includes built-in support for **automated CI/CD pipelines with Jenkins**.

- **Jenkins service is included** in `docker-compose.yml` (`jenkins` container).
- On every code push, Jenkins can automatically:
    - Pull the latest code from GitHub
    - Build all backend/frontend Docker images
    - Run tests and start or update the platform stack

**Quick Start:**
1. Start Jenkins:
   ```bash
   docker-compose up -d jenkins
    ```
2. Access Jenkins Dashboard: [http://localhost:8888](http://localhost:8888)
3. Get the initial password:
   ```bash
   docker logs -f jenkins
   ```
4. Set up your pipeline job (see sample Jenkinsfile in the repo) and connect your GitHub repository.
5. On each commit, Jenkins will automatically build and deploy the latest platform stack.
Jenkins enables true one-click automated build, test, and deployment for this microservices project.
